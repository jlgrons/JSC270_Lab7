You can choose the `Academic` -> `Student` option. The default is to sign up for a team account. This allows multiple users (ie. your and your project partner).

Be honest and thorough (ie. you are completing a natural language processing project for a data science course). Note that you will not be required to `display aggregate twitter data outside of twitter`, so you can select NO for this option. After agreeing to terms and conditions, you'll submit your application. After verifying your email (check your inbox), Twitter typically takes a day or two to review and approve your developer status.\n",
